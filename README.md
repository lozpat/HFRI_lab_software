# HFRI_lab_software
This code runs the high frame rate imaging lab experiment. It communicates with a DAQ card which controls the microdroplet dispenser and camera trigger, which in turn controls the LED. The software also controls the movement of the motorized translation stage via the ThorLabs Kinesis software package.
